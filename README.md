# Drawing on the Web Final Project

## by Eileen Lee

Since it is my last semester here at NYU, for my final project I am going to create drawings that reflect the years that I have spent here. To do this, I am going to incorporate my own photos and videos that I took throughout the years to illustrate my personal experiences. I will also include music that relates to New York City. By creating these pages, I hope to elicit feelings and experiences of nostalgia and serenity in not only myself but also the viewers, as we take in the beauty of New York City through the personal memories that I had here.


I will make my pages aesthetically relate by making most of my content black and white. My drawings will relate conceptually by incorporating visuals of New York City in all the pages. I will also make my drawings stick to an overarching theme of vintage/film camera aesthetics. In terms of interactivity, I will incorporate scroll that reveals new content when the user scrolls down. I will also incorporate animation when a user loads, clicks, or hovers on the page. To do this, I am going to use the tools we learned in class--mostly CSS animation, JavaScript, and HTML Canvas.
